# 2206. Divide Array Into Equal Pairs
   
 Hint
 You are given an integer array nums consisting of 2 * n integers.

You need to divide nums into n pairs such that:

Each element belongs to exactly one pair.
The elements present in a pair are equal.
Return true if nums can be divided into n pairs, otherwise return false.


```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
There are 6 elements in nums, so they should be divided into 6 / 2 = 3 pairs.
If nums is divided into the pairs (2, 2), (3, 3), and (2, 2), it will satisfy all the conditions.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation:
There is no way to divide nums into 4 / 2 = 2 pairs such that the pairs satisfy every condition.


Constraints:

nums.length == 2 * n
1 <= n <= 500
1 <= nums[i] <= 500

```


# 2401. Longest Nice Subarray
You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

We call a subarray of nums nice if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements that are in different positions in the subarray is equal to 0.

Return the length of the longest nice subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

Note that subarrays of length 1 are always considered nice.

```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,8,48,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest nice subarray is [3,8,48]. This subarray satisfies the conditions:
- 3 AND 8 = 0.
- 3 AND 48 = 0.
- 8 AND 48 = 0.
It can be proven that no longer nice subarray can be obtained, so we return 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,5,11,13]
Output: 1
Explanation: The length of the longest nice subarray is 1. Any subarray of length 1 can be chosen.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109
```
